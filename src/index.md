## You're not going to code that chart

It's not that you're busy with other things with the app you're building, but you are feeling the deadlines, so maybe a little bit too busy.

It's not that you're allergic to the front-end, but you kind of are.

But that chart won't write itself.

## You've played with the charting libraries

But they're all a little bland, a little too much like all the other ones.

And then you know there's this way to do all custom, but oh man the learning curve.

## But you'd still like to learn...

**Tell you what.** How about I code up a chart or two for you, and I show you how I did it, what tweaks you can make, how to plug it into your data set?

## And you'd like the chart to be pretty...

You're looking for something that stands out, matches your look, gets the details right.

How about I let you drive the "to-my-taste" department and I'll drive the "code-it-to-your-taste" department?
